### Add/Edit Blog
- If user is logged in as superuser, they can access to Add / Edit Blog post page. 

## Profiles Page
`My Profile` page is available for authenticated users and will be shown in the `My Account` Dropdown menu at the navbar which appears when you log into your account.
### My Profile Page
- In Profile Page, authenticated users can 1. edit `Delivery Information` and 2. see `Order History`.

## Admin Product Managment
Only authenticated superusers can access the admin page (1.products/add/, 2. products/edit/, 3. products/delete ). If non-logged in users try to access the url directly, it will redirect to the sign in page. If a non-superuser tries to access the url, an error message pops up which says that only a superuser can access this page.

## Features Left to Implement
There are some of features left to implement in the future which I could not add to the project this time due to time constraints. These features are great to be added for a more complete online shop service which would lead to higher customer satisfaction.

### Add an option to let the customer add their billing information
### FAQ
### Track Order

# Deployment
## Heroku Deployment with AWS
This website is deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), following these steps:
1. Install these packages to your local environment, since these packages are required to deploy a Django project on Heroku.
- [gnicorn](https://gunicorn.org/): `gnicorn` is Python WSGI(web server gataway interface) server for UNIX.
- [gninx](https://www.nginx.com/): `gninx` is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server.
- [psycopg2-binary](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-binary/): `psycopg2-binary` is PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language.
- [dj-database-url](https://pypi.org/project/dj-database-url/): `dj-database-url` allows you to utilize the 12factor inspired DATABASE_URL environment variable to configure your Django application.
2. Create a `requirements.txt` file and freeze all the modules with the command `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` in the terminal.
3. Create a `Procfile` write `web: gunicorn boutique_ado.wsgi:application` in the file.
4. `git add` and `git commit` and `git push` all the changes to the Github repositoty of this project.
5. Go to Heroku and create a **new app**. Set a name for this app and select the closest region (Europe) and click **Create app**.
6. Go to **Resources** tab in Heroku, then in the **Add-ons** search bar look for **Heorku Postgres**(you can type postgres), select **Hobby Dev â€” Free** and click **Submit Order Form** button to add it to your project.
7. In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on **Setting** > **Reveal Config Vars** and set the values as follows:

| Key | Value |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `Your AWS Access Key` |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `Your AWS Secret Access Key` |
| DATABASE_URL | `Your Postgres Database URL` |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `Your Email Password (generated by Gmail)` |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER | `Your Email Address` |
| SECRET_KEY | `Your Secret Key` |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | `Your Stripe Public Key` |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | `Your Stripe Secret Key` | 
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET | `Your Stripe WH Key` |
| USE_AWS | `True` |



8. Comment out the current database setting in settings.py, and add the code below instead. This is done temporarily to migrate the datbase on Heroku.
```
  DATABASES = {     
        'default': dj_database_url.parse("<your Postrgres database URL here>")     
    }
```
9. Migrate the database models to the Postgres database using the following commands in the terminal:
`python3 manage.py migrate`
10. Load the data fixtures into the Postgres database using the following command:
`python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`
11. Create a superuser for the Postgres database by running the following command:
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
12. Replace the database setting with the code below, so that the right database is used depending on development/deployed environment.
```
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
```
13. Disable collect static, so that Heroku won't try to collect static file with: `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1`
```

15. In Stripe, add Heroku app URL a new webhook endpoint.
16. Update the settings.py with the new Stripe environment variables and email settings.
17. Commit all the changes to Heroku. Medial files are not connected to the app yet but the app should be working on Heroku.

### Amazon Web Service S3
The static files and media files for this deployed site are hosted in the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) S3 Bucket. You will need to create S3 bucket, complete the setting up and upload static files and media files to the S3 bucket. You can find [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) for more information on the setting.
I used CORS configuration below:
```
[
  {
      "AllowedHeaders": [
          "Authorization"
      ],
      "AllowedMethods": [
          "GET"
      ],
      "AllowedOrigins": [
          "*"
      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```

- Setting for static/media files in settings.py
1. Install `boto3` and `django-storages` with a command `pip3 install boto3` and `pip3 install django-storages` in your terminal, to connect AWS S3 bucket to Django.
2. Add 'storages' to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py.
3. Add the following in settings.py.
```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Cache Control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }

    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'matthiolashops3'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-central-1'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.getenv('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```
5. Add [custom_storages.py]
6. Delete DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from Heroku Config Var.
7. Push all the changes to Github/Heroku and all the static files will be uploaded to S3 bucket.
By setting up above, Heroku will run python3 manage.py collectstatic during the build process and look for static and media files.

### Automatic Deploy on Heroku
You can enable automatic deploy in the following steps that pushes update to Heroku everytime you push to github.
1. Go to Deploy in Heroku dashboard.
2. At `Automatic deploys`, choose a github repository you want to deploy.
3. Click `Enable Automatic Deploys`.


## Local Deployment
For local deployment, you need to have an IDE (I used Gitpod for this project) and you need to install the following:
- Git, Python3, PIP3
Also, you need to create account in the following services if you don't own yet:
- Stripe, AWS (S3 bucket), Gmail

## Gitpod Reminders


To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.
